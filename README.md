## About
The mod simply renders the solar system planets in Minecraft's skybox during the night. In a way, the MC skybox is a planetarium if you think about it.

## About Ports
I personally welcome third party ports to previous minecraft versions, but I respectfully ask that you do not port to Forge or Fabric.
